# Bryan Bischof's Personal Resume

This repo is for my resume. Please take care to notice the last update in case it falls behind. Update requests(or spotted typos ;-) ) can be opened as issues.

## Steal this code

You're welcome to steal my LaTeX code as a template for your own resume. Fork the repo, and have at it. I built this over a long time stealing code from various places, so "pay it forward" and all that.
