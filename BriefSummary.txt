I've real world experience as a data professional--I've been working as a data scientist, software engineer, and researcher at IBM for close to two years--during which I received three promotions from an entry level position to forming a team and managing projects of my own inception.

I have experience with advanced analytic thinking at a high level--I recieved a Ph.D. in pure mathematics from KSU in an area of research that is a breakout topic in both the academic world--and recently--the tech world.

I'm dedicated to personal growth and expanding my skill-set as evidenced by short 1-day training programs(Galvanize and meetups), extended immersive training programs(Galvanize), self-motivated fun programming exercises, and outside data-driven projects with a group of friends.

Experience with measurable accomplishments, strong background in an analytical field, and a deep passion for the field make me an excellent candidate.
